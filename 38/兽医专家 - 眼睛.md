1. **Introduction**
    - The animal ear is multifunctional serving purposes beyond just hearing.
    - Function: auditory perception balance communication and potential health indicators.
    - Healthy ears influence environmental interactions communication abilities and overall comfort.
    - Emphasis on the holistic nature of health with ears playing a significant role in an animal's overall wellbeing.
    - The lecture aims to explore the importance of ear health in animals.

2. **Auditory function**
    - Ears enable animals to detect sounds ensuring safety and communication

3. **Balance and equilibrium**
    - The inner ear is crucial for balance and coordination

4. **Communication**
    - Ears assist in interpretation and communication

5. **Disease prevention**
    - Regular care is needed to prevent infections and complication.

6. **Overall comfort**
    - Ear problems can cause discomfort and lead to harmful behaviours.

7. **The ear's health can be compromised by various ailments many of which have dermatological origins or implications.**
    - The skin is the body's largest organ that:
        - Acts as the primary barrier against external environmental factors.
        - Protect internal structures and systems.
    - The epithelial components of the ear and the skin share many characteristics such as disruptions or diseases affecting the skin can also affect the ears.
    - A comprehensive understanding of the dermatological aspects of ear health is crucial for effective veterinary care.

8. **Anatomy and Physiology of the Animal Ear**
    - Basic structure: External ear middle ear and inner ear

9. **External ear:**
    - Composed of auricular and annular cartilage.
    - The auricular cartilage of the pinna forms a funnel-like shape initiating the external ear canal.
    - The canal has a vertical section (about an inch) that transitions to a horizontal section both containing auricular and annular cartilage.

10. **Middle ear:**
    - Contains an air-filled chamber called the tympanic cavity.
    - Houses three small bones for hearing known as auditory ossicles.
    - Features a semi-transparent eardrum with two parts: Pars flaccida and Pars tensa.
    - Components of the tympanic cavity:
        - Minor epitympanic recess.
        - Significant ventral bulla.
        - Main tympanic bulla.
    - The medial side showcases a ridge called the promontory which houses the cochlea.
    - Behind the promontory is a round window with a delicate membrane.
    - Above is an oval window with a diaphragm where the stapes bone connects.
    - The auditory tube connects the nasopharynx to the front of the main tympanic cavity.
    - Auditory ossicles amplify sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.

11. **Inner ear:**
    - Located within the petrous section of the temporal bone.
    - Encased in a bone-made maze.
    - This bony structure contains another maze made of membranes.
    - Contains sensory structures essential for hearing and balance.

12. **Definition and classification of otitis**
    - Otitis externa
        - Refers to the inflammation of the external ear canal including the pinna.
        - Accounts for 10 to 20% of dog-related consultations.
        - Classification of causes:
            - Predisposing Factors
            - Primary Factors Perpetuating and Secondary Factors
        - Data from insured Australian dogs in 2016 and 2017 showed otitis externa had an incidence rate of 34.12 and 34.82 per 1000 dog years at risk respectively.
        - Dogs may experience multiple escalating infections in their lifetime with potential microorganism resistance to treatments.

13. **Otitis media**
    - Refers to the inflammation of the middle ear containing the auditory ossicles.
    - Can result from untreated otitis externa or due to tumours polyps etc.
    - In dogs:
        - 16% with acute otitis externa and 52% with chronic otitis externa develop otitis media.
    - Chronic otitis externa can progress to otitis media.
    - Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM) is notable in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels presenting symptoms similar to syringomyelia.
    - In cats:
        - 63% diagnosed with otitis media/interna showed no previous ear infection signs.
    - Commonly associated with past respiratory issues or inflammatory growths.
    - Rarely otitis media may follow otitis externa.

14. **Otitis interna**
    - Refers to the inflammation of the inner ear where the cochlea and vestibular system reside.
    - Can result from progressing otitis media or systemic infections.
    - Symptoms include dizziness loss of balance involuntary eye movement (nystagmus) and hearing loss.
    - Less common than otitis externa or media typically presenting as a complication of these conditions.

15. **Otitis externa frequently involves a series of interconnected factors (Rosser 2004):**
    - Primary factors
        - Direct triggers or elements that initiate inflammation of the external ear canal.
    - Secondary factors
        - Issues arising in an already compromised ear.
        - Often become persistent or recurring if the root cause isn't addressed.
    - Predisposing factors
        - Processes or elements increasing the risk of otitis externa.
        - Work in tandem with primary or ongoing causes to produce the clinical condition.
        - Recognition and management are crucial for a holistic treatment approach.
    - Perpetuating factors
        - Do not initiate otitis externa but play a role in its continuation once established.

16. **III. Primary Causes of Otitis Externa (OE) in Dermatology**
    - Allergies
        - Leading cause of OE.
        - Atopic dermatitis causes OE symptoms in 55% of affected dogs. For 3-5% of these dogs, it's their only symptom.
        - OE is seen in up to 80% of dogs with food allergies and is the sole symptom in 25% of cases.
        - A study by Saridomichelakis et al. (2007) identified allergic dermatitis as the primary OE cause in 43 out of 100 dogs. Of these:
            - 12 had acute OE.
            - 31 had chronic or recurring OE.
            - Only 8 were diagnosed with atopic dermatitis; 2 had adverse reactions to food.
            - 30 (69.8%) showed itching excluding around the ears.
            - 42 (97.7%) had self-inflicted skin lesions.

17. **Parasites**
    - Otodectes cynotis (ear mite) is responsible for over 50% of feline OE cases.
    - Otodectes cynotis infestation leads to itching in 41.5% of cats and unusual ear secretions in 85.4%.
    - Infestation rates: Young cats have the highest rate of singular infestation (10.38%); elderly dogs have the lowest (0.89%). Cats overall are more prone to infestations than dogs.
    - Other parasites like Sarcoptes Notoedres Cheyletiella harvest mites and the spinose ear tick can also cause OE. Demodex mites can result in waxy ear infections.

18. **Autoimmune skin diseases**
    - Conditions such as pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus erythematosus, and discoid lupus erythematosus can affect the external ear canals.
    - Seldom primary causes for OE, they usually accompany skin lesions elsewhere.
    - Pemphigus foliaceus, a prevalent autoimmune skin condition in dogs, disrupts cell-to-cell binding causing pustules, crusts, and scales.

19. **Endocrine disease**
    - Hypothyroidism in dogs can lead to skin issues resulting in OE.
    - Skin changes include seborrhea, hair thinning, hyperpigmentation, reduced healing, and increased infection susceptibility.
    - The dry skin from hypothyroidism can elevate wax production in the ear, fostering bacterial and yeast growth which can progress to OE.

20. **Epithelialization disorder**
    - Idiopathic seborrhea:
        - A keratinization disorder particularly evident in American Cocker Spaniels.
        - Causes alterations in discharges from the ear canal's ceruminous and sebaceous glands and prolongs epithelial renewal time.
        - Leads to an accumulation of keratosebaceous waste in the outer ear, promoting microbial growth.
    - Sebaceous adenitis:
        - A rare skin condition causing inflammation and damage to the sebaceous glands which produce skin oils.
        - Most frequently affects breeds like Standard Poodles, Akitas, and Vizslas.
        - Dry skin from this condition makes the ear canal susceptible to inflammation and infection.
        - Lack of protective oils supports bacterial growth in the ear canal.
        - Inflammation thickens the ear canal's skin, obstructing the natural drainage of earwax and increasing infection risk.

21. **Foreign bodies:**
    - Items like grass seeds or burrs can become trapped in the ear, leading to intense irritation and inflammation.
    - Signs include head shaking or ear scratching by the affected animals.
    - Avoid letting pets roll in dirt or sand to prevent foreign object entry.

22. **Medication reactions:**
    - Reactions to certain medications or topical irritants can trigger otitis externa.
    - Substances such as alcohol may dry out the ear, causing discomfort.
    - Solutions with a low pH disrupt the natural acidic balance of a dog's ear, favoring bacterial or yeast growth.
    - Ingredients like propylene glycol in some products can irritate sensitive dogs.

23. **Ear canal neoplasia and polyps:**
    - A significant cause of otitis in dogs and cats.
    - Neoplasia can lead to benign or malignant tumors in the ear canal, resulting in obstructions and inflammation.
    - Polyps, non-cancerous growths, can also arise in the ear canal, causing similar issues.
    - Both disrupt the ear's natural environment, creating conditions conducive to bacterial and yeast infections.
    - A detailed ear canal examination is essential for early identification and effective management of the condition.

24. **IV. Secondary Factors**
    - Microbial infections
        - Bacteria or yeast in otitis externa cases are opportunists, not primary pathogens.
        - Even if infections don't recur post-treatment, they should be seen as a one-time disturbance to the external ear canal.
        - Recurring infections indicate a need to determine the root cause.
        - If not addressed, bacteria and yeast can grow resistant to treatments, potentially becoming immune to all antimicrobial agents.

25. **Bacterial infections**
    - Staphylococcus spp.:
        - Includes species like S. pseudintermedius, which is a Gram-positive bacteria linked to various infections in dogs (skin, ear, urinary, etc.)
        - While commonly found on the skin, some strains can become opportunistic pathogens in compromised ear environments, leading to acute or chronic otitis externa.
        - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a strain resistant to multiple antibiotics, complicating treatment.
    - Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
        - A significant Gram-negative bacteria in otitis externa.
        - Notable for strains resistant to multiple drugs.
        - Produces a characteristic foul odor.
        - Known for biofilm production, which challenges treatment.
    - Biofilm
        - Recognized as a significant virulent factor in chronic infections.
        - Enhances bacterial resistance to treatments.
        - Protects bacteria from both the immune response and direct medication.
        - Described as a protective layer or "slime" produced by bacteria.
        - Comprises components such as:
            - Extracellular polysaccharides.
            - Structural proteins.
            - Nucleic acids.
        - Particularly influential in infections caused by Pseudomonas.
        - Identified in approximately 40% of Pseudomonas samples.
        - Requires higher antimicrobial concentrations for effective treatment due to its presence.
    - Study by Fernandez et al. (2006):
        - Evaluated 53 dogs with otitis externa admitted to ZSU/UVP.
        - Most common bacterial agents identified:
            - Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 22.22%
            - Proteus mirabilis: 13.89%
            - Staphylococcus aureus: 12.50%
            - Staphylococcus epidermidis: 8.33%
            - Escherichia coli: 5.56%
            - Staphylococcus coagulase-negative: 5.56%
        - In the control group (healthy patients):
            - Most common bacteria: Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus coagulase-negative each at 16.67%.
        - Cytology tests showed Malassezia pachydermatis present in 69.8% of the samples.

26. **Fungal Infections**
    - Malassezia pachydermatis:
        - Predominant yeast associated with otitis externa.
        - Found in 20% to 50% of healthy ears.
        - Present in up to 72% of infected ears (as per August 1988).
        - A normal skin inhabitant, but it can overgrow in the moist environment of an inflamed ear.
        - Causes pruritus and emits a distinct yeasty odor.
        - Often observed alongside allergic skin disease.
    - Other fungal organisms occasionally identified in affected ears include:
        - Candida spp.
        - Aspergillus spp.
        - Microsporum
        - Trichophytum spp.
        - Sporotrhrix schenkii
        - Paecilomyces.

27. **V. Predisposing Factors**
    - Ear conformation and hair growth
    - Breeds predisposed due to ear shape and size
        - O'Neill et al. (2021) study findings:
            - Designer breeds had 1.63 times higher odds of developing otitis externa compared to crossbred dogs.
            - Dogs with pendulous ear carriage had 1.76 times the odds, and those with V-shaped drop ear carriage had 1.84 times the odds.
            - Poodle and Spaniel types had 1.91 and 1.24 times the odds respectively
