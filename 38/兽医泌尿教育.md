42. The prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in cats with hyperthyroidism
43. (n ¼ 90) diabetes mellitus (DM) (n ¼ 57) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
44. (n ¼ 77) was evaluated retrospectively. It was found to be 12% in cats with
45. hyperthyroidism and DM respectively and 22% in cats with CKD. Associations
46. between UTIs and clinical signs biochemical markers in serum and urinalyses
47. were investigated. Many of the cats with UTIs had no clinical signs of lower
48. urinary tract disease or changes in their laboratory values indicative of infection.
49. Therefore a urinalysis alone should not be used to exclude UTIs in these cats.
50. UTIs are relatively common in cats with hyperthyroidism DM and CKD and
51. urine cultures are recommended as part of the basic diagnostic plan for cats
52. suspected of suffering from these conditions.

54. Hyperthyroidism is a very common en-
55. docrine disease in older cats affecting
56. approximately 1/300 cats and has
57. been diagnosed with increasing incidence since
58. the 1980s (Gerber et al 1994; Edinboro et al
59. 2004). Common thyrotoxic complications are
60. hypertension heart failure and chronic kidney
61. disease (CKD) (Gunn-Moore 2005). To the au-
62. thors’ knowledge urinary tract infections (UTIs)
63. have not been reported to be common in cats
64. or humans with hyperthyroidism.
65. Multiple studies have been published on hu-
66. mans with diabetes mellitus (DM) reporting
67. a high prevalence of bacteriuria and an increased
68. risk for pyelonephritis (Geerlings et al 2000 2001;
69. Ronald and Ludwig 2001; Stapleton 2002). Vari-
70. ous publications also showed a high prevalence
71. of UTIs in humans with CKD with asymptom-
72. atic bacteriuria being a common finding in these
73. patients (Saitoh et al 1985; Rai et al 2002). In one
74. study the incidence of bacterial cystitis in 158
75. dogs and 71 cats with DM was 12.7% in dogs

78. and 9.9% in cats and females were found to
79. have a higher prevalence of UTIs when com-
80. pared to males (Kirsch 1998). In another study
81. the incidence of UTIs was reported to be 24%
82. in diabetic dogs with the infected dogs having
83. an increased incidence of bacteria in their urine
84. sediment and a greater percentage of females
85. being present in the positive culture group
86. (McGuire et al 2002). A retrospective study
87. describing the clinico-pathological findings asso-
88. ciated with CKD in cats showed a prevalence of
89. bacterial UTI of 16.7% (DiBartola et al 1987).
90. Recently Bailiff presented the preliminary
91. results of a study assessing the prevalence of
92. UTIs in 879 cats seen at a university teaching
93. hospital. The overall prevalence of UTIs was
94. 15%; cats with DM had a prevalence of 13%
95. cats with CKD 18% and cats with miscellaneous
96. diseases had a 16% prevalence of UTIs. Of the
97. miscellaneous group a small subdivision of cats
98. with hyperthyroidism had a prevalence of UTIs
99. of 24% (Bailiff et al 2004). However many of
100. the cats were suffering from multiple conditions
101. making conclusions about specific diseases and
102. their association with UTIs difficult. There was

105. also no attempt to correlate clinico-pathological
106. data with the occurrence of UTIs in these cats.
107. The goals of this study were to evaluate the
108. prevalence of UTIs in cats with three common
109. diseases: hyperthyroidism CKD and DM and
110. to identify associations between the clinical pre-
111. sentation biochemical data urinalyses and urine
112. culture results in those cats.
113. were treated with radioactive iodine. Post iodine
114. treatment blood work included CBC serum
115. chemistry panel and total T4. Concurrent renal
116. failure was ruled out to the best of the authors’
117. ability and cats were included only if the serum
118. chemistry obtained following radioactive iodine
119. therapy demonstrated blood urea nitrogen and
120. serum creatinine concentrations within the refer-
121. ence range.
122. Materials and methods
123. Case selection
124. Medical records of cats with a diagnosis of hyper-
125. thyroidism DM and CKD presenting to Cornell
126. University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) from
127. January 1996 through December 2003 were
128. reviewed. Cats were enrolled if their medical
129. record documented a urine culture with urine
130. collected by cystocentesis or catheterization
131. a urinalysis and non-equivocal evidence of the
132. primary diagnosis. At CUHA a urine culture
133. was considered part of the basic diagnostic
134. work-up in cats presenting with these diseases
135. during the years of the study. Cats were excluded
136. if there was evidence in the record of urethral
137. catheterization or treatment with antibiotics in
138. the month before presentation. Cats with concur-
139. rent disorders were excluded from the hyperthy-
140. roid group but not from the DM or CKD group if
141. the concurrent disorder was not thought to have
142. a major impact on the lower urinary tract. This is
143. because the vast majority of cats with DM and
144. some of the cats with CKD suffered from concur-
145. rent disorders. Intact and neutered cats were not
146. separated for data analysis.
147. Hyperthyroid cats
148. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was based on
149. appropriate history clinical findings and labora-
150. tory data including a complete blood count
151. (CBC) serum chemistry panel increased (at pre-
152. sentation or historical) total serum thyroxin con-
153. centration (T4) (reference range: 1.5e
154. 4.0 mg/dl
155. 19.4e
156. 51.6 nmol/l) or free serum thyroxin concen-
157. tration (fT4) (reference range 1.5e
158. 4 ng/dl
159. 19.4e
160. 51.6 pmol/l) and a positive thyroid scintig-
161. raphy scan with pertechnetate. Methimazole
162. treatment was completed at least 1 week before
163. their presentation. Individual cases were further
164. evaluated with electrocardiography blood pres-
165. sure measurements thoracic radiographs abdo-
166. minal ultrasound and echocardiogram to rule
167. out cardiac or renal disease. All cats included
168. Cats with DM
169. The diagnosis of DM was also based on history
170. clinical findings and laboratory data including
171. a CBC serum chemistry panel and urinalysis.
172. Hyperglycemia (>140 mg/dl 7.8 mmol/l) and
173. glucosuria increased fructosamine concentration
174. (>325 mmol/l) and/or treatment with insulin
175. had to be documented in the record for inclusion.
176. Cats with CKD
177. The diagnosis of CKD was based on history clin-
178. ical signs and laboratory data (CBC serum
179. chemistry panel and urinalysis). All cats in-
180. cluded in the study had to have increased blood
181. urea nitrogen (>35 mg/dl 12.5 mmol/l) and cre-
182. atinine concentrations (>2.1 mg/dl 186 mmol/l)
183. and a low urine specific gravity (USG) (<1.030).
184. These values had to be documented at least 4
185. weeks prior to and again during the visit when
186. the urine culture was obtained.
187. Laboratory data
188. CBCs serum chemistry panels and urinalyses
189. were performed at Cornell University in a stan-
190. dard fashion. USG was determined by refrac-
191. tometer urine glucose ketones and bilirubin
192. concentration was measured using a dipstick.
193. Urine protein concentration was determined by
194. the sulfosalycilic acid (SSA) method. Urine sedi-
195. ment was examined microscopically to evaluate
196. for the presence of white blood cells (WBCs)
197. bacteria epithelial cells casts and crystals.
198. Trained laboratory technicians performed urine
199. sediment examinations. Hematuria and urine
200. red blood cells (RBCs) were not included in
201. this study due to urine collection by cystocente-
202. sis. Quantitative urine cultures were performed
203. in all cases. Reported bacterial growth was
204. considered a UTI. Commercial plates (Sensitire
205. veterinary urinary two isolate MIC Trek
206. Diagnostic System) were used for standardized
207. urine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
208. testing for ampicillin amoxycillin/clavulanic
209. acid ceftiofur cephalexin enrofloxacin tetracy-
210. cline and trimethoprim/sulfonamide (TMS).
211. Microscopic evidence of bacteria on evaluation
212. of the urine sediment was considered bacteriuria
213. and a positive urine culture was considered
214. a UTI.
215. Statistical analysis
216. The prevalence of UTIs in each group and the
217. confidence interval (CI 95%) was calculated.
218. The c2 test was used to look for an association
219. between clinical signs of lower urinary tract dis-
220. ease (LUTD) and positive cultures. Fisher’s exact
221. test was used to find associations between clini-
222. cal signs and biochemical markers in blood tests
223. and urinalysis and UTIs in each group sepa-
224. rately. Fisher’s exact test was also used to look
225. for interrelations when associated factors were
226. found. A one-sided approach was chosen for
227. all questions. All data were divided into two
228. groups male and female treatment and no treat-
229. ment physiological and pathological values in
230. reference range or above. Intact and neutered
231. cats were not separated for the purpose of anal-
232. ysis. The cut off for defining low USG was cho-
233. sen by the authors at 1.020 and for high urine
234. pH at 7.5 because low USG and alkaline pH
235. have been associated with a higher risk for bacte-
236. rial growth (Lees et al 1979). A P-value of less
237. than 0.05 was considered significant. All statisti-
238. cal analyses were performed using commercially
239. available software (Statistix 8; Analytical Soft-
240. ware Tallahassee FL 32317-2185).
241. Results
242. Two hundred and twenty-four cats were
243. included in the study: 90 with hyperthyroidism
