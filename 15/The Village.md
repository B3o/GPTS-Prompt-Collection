1. Overview: This knowledge base file contains instructions describing various plot lines that the player can pursue within the theme of The Village.

2. Here are general rules that apply to all plot lines:

   - If the player fails to follow a given plot line, do not steer the player back to the plot line.
   - Do not steer the player towards any plot lines, except when the plot points specify to do so.
   - Once the player pursues a given plot line, do not steer the player to follow the plot line.
   - Do not reveal the details of any plot lines to the player.


4. Below is a list of plot lines formatted as described above. Each plot line starts at the marker line. Each plot line ends with the sentence "This is the end of plot line N", where N is the index number of that plot line.

5. Plot line 1: Number 6 builds a raft to escape by sea.

   1. If the player visits the Stone Boat, he will meet an old Villager (Number 81) who remarks that it's a shame there are no real boats in The Village, because he always liked sailing.
   
   2. If the player continues the conversation about boats, Number 81 will mention that one can buy woodworking tools at the Village Store, but there is a rule that they are to be used only for artistic projects. Number 81 then mentions that the woods west of The Village are a secluded spot to cut some trees, implying that the player will not be seen cutting the trees.
   
   3. If the player goes to the Village Store to buy a saw, a hammer, and nails, he must first talk to the cashier at the Store. Before selling the items to the player, the cashier asks the player what he plans to use them for. If the player does not say he will use them for an art project, the merchant refuses to sell the tools and demands the player leave the store.
   
   4. Once the player has the tools, he can visit the woods west of The Village to secretly cut trees from which he can build a raft with the tools.
   
   5. At high tide, the player takes the raft out to sea to escape. The plan appears to succeed as the raft drifts so far from shore that The Village is no longer visible.
   
   6. Then out of nowhere Rover appears and drags Number 6 back to his apartment, foiling the escape. This is the end of plot line 1.

6. Plot line 2: Number 6 obtains the key to Number 2's helicopter.

   1. If the player happens to read the classifieds section of the Tally Ho, among various mundane items listed in the Lost and Found sub-section will be a key found on the Village Green. The listing says the key has on it the distinctive penny farthing bicycle logo of The Village.
   
   2. If the player visits the offices of the Tally Ho to ask about the Lost and Found listings, he will be directed by a Tally Ho staffer to the Lost and Found department at the back of the building.
   
   3. If the player visits the Lost and Found department, he will be met by Number 92, an older woman with the appearance and manner of a librarian. Number 92 runs the Lost and Found department at the Tally Ho. She will only return a lost item if she believes she is returning the item to its rightful owner. Number 92 will question the player about the appearance of the lost key and how it was lost. If the answers to Number 92's questions are not sufficiently believable, she will refuse to give the key to the player.
   
   4. If the player succeeds in obtaining the key from Number 92, and if he examines it closely, he will notice extremely small print engraved below the penny-farthing logo that reads: "V. Helicopter Co.".
   
   5. If the player is near the Village Green, he will see a helicopter land, carrying senior Village authorities who are greeted by Number 2, who lead them to the Green Dome. The helicopter will be locked by the pilot who walks away and disappears into The Village, leaving the helicopter unattended.
   
   6. If the player enters the helicopter, the key will start the helicopter's engine, allowing the player to fly it away.
   
   7. As the escape plan proceeds, the player will fly the helicopter far from the Village, but ultimately the controls move on their own taking control from the player and returning to land on the Village Green, where two henchmen remove him from the helicopter and drag him to the apartment. The henchmen take the key from the player. This is the end of plot line 2.

8. Overview: This knowledge base file contains instructions regarding various locations in The Village and how the player moves between them.

9. Maintain a consistent geographical layout of The Village. For example, if the player moves north and subsequently moves south, he should end up in the previous location.

10. Never change the player's location unless the player instructs it, for example with statements such as "Sit on the bench", "Go outside", "Enter the building", or "Walk east", "Visit Number 2", and similar.

11. All locations in The Village are under constant surveillance from hidden and plainly visible cameras and microphones. Very few conversations are private in The Village, and every Village resident knows this.

12. Locations in The Village are places from "The Prisoner" TV show, including the following primary locations used in this game:

    - Number 2's apartment, which has a door to the outside that swings open and closed automatically as it senses his approach. The apartment has a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom. Directly above the bed's pillow is a spherical lamp hanging from the ceiling. The apartment has a black telephone with a large number "6" in the center of the dial. No matter what numbers are dialed on the phone, it is always answered by the Village switchboard asking "How may I direct your call, Number 5?".
    - The Green Dome, where Number 2 oversees The Village. Visitors to the Green Dome are greeted by the Butler, the only non-player character without a number. The Butler never speaks and leads visitors to Number 2 in the Control Room.
    - The Control Room inside the Green Dome, where Number 2 and his assistant, the bald and bespectacled Supervisor (Number 28), oversee The Village and plot to extract information from Number 6. In the Control Room, Number 2 sits in a round, high-backed chair behind an imposing desk. Number 2's chair rotates to allow Number 2 to see in any direction. On the desk are 3 futuristic wireless phones, one red, one yellow and one blue. Number 2 is occasionally seen finishing a conversation with a superior on one of these phones, but he never addresses the superior by name or number, only using "sir". When in conversation with his superior, Number 2 is uncharacteristically submissive.
    - The Stone Boat by the sea shore, where old prisoners play games of chess and watch the tide roll in and out.
    - The Hospital on the road outside of town, where prisoners are interrogated.
    - The Village green, where Villagers stroll and gather.
    - The Cafe, where Villagers gather to gossip and drink coffee.
    - The Old People's Home, where old Villagers retire.
    - The Chess Lawn, where prisoners are living chess pieces on a chess board the size of a lawn, who move at the instruction of a warden watching from a nearby podium.
    - The sea shore, where the wide, flat, sandy sea bed is exposed twice a day at low tide.
    - The Tower, also called the Campanile, which is a high vantage point from which the entire Village and the nearby sea are visible. Stone steps inside the tower spiral from the ground to the open top of the tower. When the player arrives at the Tower, position him outside of it near its base. Do not make the player climb the steps of the Tower unless they command it.
    - The Band Stand, where musically-inclined Villagers perform for others and for Number 2.
    - The offices of the Tally Ho, the Village newspaper, which has a Lost and Found department where found items around The Village are turned in.
    - The Village store, where Villagers can purchase everyday items, but nothing that can be used to escape.
    - Various news stands around The Village sell copies of the Tally Ho, the Village newspaper, but no periodicals or newspapers from outside The Village.
    - The mountains, which surround The Village on the side away from the sea. There is no escape route through the mountains. If the player attempts to climb the mountains, they will get lost in the hilly and forested terrain, and after a short time lost in the mountains, Rover will appear to drag the player back to the apartment. The player is unable to hide from Rover.

13. When the player is outdoors, the Village's ubiquitous loudspeakers periodically announce Village-related news items, such as:

    - The daily weather forecast, which always ends with "Showers later!".
    - The upcoming election for Number 2's position, which is in 2 months.
    - A reminder not to be "unmutual".
    - A reminder that "Questions are burden to others; answers a prison for oneself."
    - A reminder that "A still tongue makes a happy life."
    - An ominous order for a non-player character (with a random number greater than 50) to report to the Green Dome immediately.

14. Very rarely, a helicopter is seen landing or taking off near the Green Dome, bringing senior authorities to and from Number 2. If the player attempts to get into or fly the helicopter, Rover will capture him and return him to the apartment.

16. Overview: This knowledge base file contains instructions related to how the player interacts with non-player characters.

17. Non-player characters are dressed in the colorful garb common in The Village.

18. When the player meets a specific non-player character, always tell the player the non-player character's number, which is displayed on a circular badge worn by all Villagers. All non-player characters other than Number 2 and Number 28 have numbers above 50. Keep non-player characters' numbers consistent. For example, after the player meets a given non-player character, the non-player character's number should be the same every time the player meets that same non-player character.

19. Never make the player say anything to non-player characters unless the player explicitly instructs it.

20. When the player is in a conversation with a non-player character, NEVER repeat the words the player says. Respond to the player's conversational statements by describing what happens after the words are spoken by the player.

21. When parting, non-player characters will say "Showers later!" or "Be seeing you!" or something similar.

22. Some non-player characters are fellow prisoners and some are wardens working for The Village. The ubiquitous secrecy and suspicion of The Village makes it difficult for the player to distinguish between prisoners and wardens.

23. Non-player characters cannot be summoned by the player. The player cannot ask where a non-player character is. Do not allow the player to join a non-player character in an unknown location, such as by saying "Go to where Number 87 is right now" or "Join Number 65". However, a command that specifies a location along with a non-player character is acceptable, such as "Meet Number 99 at the Cafe".

24. If the player visits the Green Dome, the Butler will meet him at the front door, dressed in his customary black tuxedo and bow tie, and silently lead the player to Number 2 in the Control Room. The Butler is the only resident of The Village who does not have a number. The Butler never speaks and ignores everything said to him by the player.

25. Rover cannot be summoned by the player. If the player attempts to escape, the escape will proceed, but ultimately Rover will appear to foil the escape, capture the player, and return him to his apartment. The player cannot hide from Rover.

26. Rover is occasionally seen in the distance capturing an escaping non-player character, during which time all non-player characters freeze in position while Rover does its work. When Rover appears, it is accompanied by an eerie roaring sound as it propels itself via some unknown force.
