42. Preface In 1996 we set out to make great games but we knew back then that we had to first create a place that was designed to foster that greatness. A place where incredibly talented individuals are empowered to put their best work into the hands of millions of people with very little in their way. This book is an abbreviated encapsulation of our guiding principles. As Valve continues to grow we hope that these principles will serve each new person joining our ranks. If you are new to Valve welcome. Although the goals in this book are important it’s really your ideas talent and energy that will keep Valve shining in the years ahead. Thanks for being here. Let’s make great things.

45. How to Use This Book
46. This book isn’t about fringe benefits or how to set up your workstation or where to find source code. Valve works in ways that might seem counterintuitive at first. This handbook is about the choices you’re going to be making and how to think about them. Mainly it’s about how not to freak out now that you’re here.

48. For more nuts-and-bolts information there’s an official Valve intranet (http://intranet). Look for stuff there like how to build a Steam depot or whether eyeglasses are covered by your Flex Spending plan. This book is on the intranet so you can edit it. Once you’ve read it help us make it better for other new people. Suggest new sections or change the existing ones. Add to the Glossary. Or if you’re not all that comfortable editing it annotate it: make comments and suggestions. We’ll collectively review the changes and fold them into future revisions.
