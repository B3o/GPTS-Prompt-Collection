   HARVARD WRITING PROJECT BRIEF GUIDE SERIES
   A Brief Guide to the Elements of the Academic Essay
   by Gordon Harvey

   Gordon Harvey’s “Elements of the Academic Essay” provide a possible vocabulary for commenting on student writing. Instructors in Harvard College Writing Program tend to use some version of this vocabulary when talking about and commenting on student writing so it’s likely that your students will be familiar with some of the terms and concepts below. Using these terms consistently when you comment on student writing will help your students see patterns in their own writing that might otherwise remain elusive to them.

   1. Thesis: your main insight or idea about a text or topic and the main proposition that your essay demonstrates. It should be true but arguable (not obviously or patently true but one alternative among several) be limited enough in scope to be argued in a short composition and with available evidence and get to the heart of the text or topic being analyzed (not be peripheral). It should be stated early in some form and at some point recast sharply (not just be implied) and it should govern the whole essay (not disappear in places).
   2. Motive: the reason which you give at the start of your essay why someone might want or need to read an essay on this topic and to hear your particular thesis argued— why that thesis isn’t just obvious to all why other people might hold other theses on your topic (that you think are wrong or insufficient) or be puzzled or unclear about it. This won’t necessarily be the reason you got interested in the topic (which could be private and idiosyncratic) or the personal motivation behind your engagement with it. It’s the reason why your argument isn’t idiosyncratic but rather is interesting to the general reader. The motive you set up should be genuine: a misapprehension or puzzle that an intelligent reader (not a straw dummy) would really have a point that such a reader would really overlook. Defining motive should be the main business of your introductory paragraphs where it is often introduced by a form of the complicating word “but.”
   3. Keyterms: the handful of recurring concepts or basic oppositions upon which your argument rests usually literal but sometimes a ruling metaphor. An essay’s keyterms should be clear in their meaning and appear throughout (not be abandoned half-way); they should be appropriate for the subject at hand (not unfair or too simple—a false or constraining opposition); and they should not be inert clichés or abstractions (e.g. “the evils of society”).

   Using these terms consistently when you comment on student writing will help your students see patterns in their own writing that might otherwise remain elusive to them.

2. Guidelines for Essay Writing

   1. Begin by choosing a topic that interests you (unless the specific topic is assigned) and that you know something about.
   2. Brainstorm briefly for supporting ideas an approach for the introduction and organization of the paragraphs. Clustering freewriting and/or a brief outline can help.
   3. Make sure the introduction has a clear thesis statement located at the end of the first paragraph to give the essay focus and direction.
   4. Organize body paragraphs logically. Make sure each paragraph is closely related to the topic and discusses one major point or group of related points. Each body paragraph should have a topic sentence and sufficient supports related to it. The sentences in any paragraph should follow an orderly logical sequence. Also be sure that paragraphs do not overlap in content but have smooth transitions from one to the other.
   5. Make sure the conclusion relates to the original thesis statement in a logical way. Avoid introducing new or off-topic ideas.
   6. Read through the essay for relevance. Is the whole essay on the topic and in the mode required? Do body paragraphs support the thesis statement? Do paragraph supports relate to the topic sentence? Does the conclusion relate to the thesis statement?
   7. Read the essay a second time for cohesion. Do the parts connect together well? Are there logical links between ideas? Are more or different transitions needed?
   8. Read the essay a third time for parallelism. Are there awkward sentence constructions or missed points in a paragraph discussion? Are all items in each series listed in similar grammatical form?
   9. Read the essay a fourth time for clarity and style. Are any sections unclear? Are there any vague pronouns awkward or informal phrases or excess wording? Does it sound professional and polished?
   10. Read the essay a final time for mechanics looking at grammar spelling punctuation word forms verb tense and pronoun agreement.

   STEPS OF A BASIC ESSAY

   I. Introduction (establishes the paper’s topic)
   A. Opening statements (Sentences containing some general comments about the subject at hand)
   B. Thesis Statement (1-2 sentences saying what the paper is about and how it will be broken down. Whatever points are specified here will be reiterated in the Body in the *same order*.)
   EX: Teenage drivers have the highest rate of accidents than any other group of drivers. Due to their lack of judgment lack of experience and unwarranted aggression the high insurance premiums of teenage drivers are more than justified.

   II. Body (describes the paper’s main points)
   A. First Topic (not the strongest point)
   1. Write one or two paragraphs (dependent on paper length) discussing the first idea in detail. In the same section back up each paragraph with research facts examples an anecdote (a short personal story) or some type of descriptive justification.
   2. The last sentence in this section should be a transitional one. Try to make a statement that sums up the last paragraph while also introducing the new topic.
   EX: Not only do teen drivers’ decisions show a marked lack of judgment but they also show a problematic lack of experience.
   B. Second Topic (also not the strongest point)
   1. Write one or two paragraphs discussing the 2nd idea in detail.
   2. In the same section back up the ideas with research facts examples an anecdote or some type of descriptive justification.
   3. The last sentence in this section should be a transitional one as well. Try to make a statement that sums up the last paragraph while also introducing the new topic.
   EX: Obviously since the new driver’s lack of experience is such an important factor high insurance rates are warranted in reflecting that. Similarly overt aggression is also a contributing point in expensive monthly premiums.
   C. Third Topic (this should be your strongest point or argument)
   1. Write one or two paragraphs discussing the 3rd idea in detail.
   2. In the same section back up the ideas with research facts examples an anecdote or some type of descriptive justification.
   3. The last sentence in this section should be a transitional one as well. Try to make a statement that sums up the last paragraph while also hinting that the paper is coming to a conclusion or ending.
   EX: Clearly the unwarranted aggression of the new driver is another justifiable reason for the high monthly rates.
   III. Conclusion (wraps up the paper)
   A. Summarizing Statements (1-2 sentences rehashing the main points of the paper. Do not ever introduce new thoughts into the concluding paragraph.)
   B. Reiteration of the Thesis (1-2 sentences restating the thesis in different words than used in the first paragraph)
   C. Final Thought (1 sentence that leaves the reader with your final thought that applies to the topic)
   EX: The new driver should be held accountable for his/her actions. Therefore high teenage insurance rates are justifiable since experience judgment and aggression are common factors found in young drivers. While at first glance insurance rates for new drivers may seem overly exorbitant these rates merely reflect the serious challenges that come with being a new driver.
