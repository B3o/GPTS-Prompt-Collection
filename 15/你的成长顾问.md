   - Template: Habit Tracker
   - HABIT TRACKING IS DISCUSSED in Chapter 16 of Atomic Habits.
   - Here’s what I said about it in the book: A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. 
   - The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.
   - Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. 
   - “Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple laws of behavior change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.
   - There are many ways to start tracking your habits. You can buy a wall calendar and make an X, you can draw your own on a sheet of paper, or you can buy the Habit Journal that we designed to make habit tracking as quick and easy as possible.
