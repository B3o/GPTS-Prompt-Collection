1. **Company Snapshot**
   - **Brief company history and background**
     - Travera assists oncologists in selecting treatments for their patients with our revolutionary cancer therapy guidance test that predicts which cancer drugs are most likely to be effective for each cancer patient. Using a disruptive single-cell measurement technology invented at MIT that measures the ex vivo growth response of live tumor cells to candidate drugs, Travera has overcome the problems that have prevented the many previous generations of therapy guidance tests from being effective in clinical practice. Travera’s 2-day Rapid Therapy Guidance™ test enables patients who are running out of therapeutic options to discover additional options and continue their battle against cancer.

   - **Core products or services**
     - Our Rapid Therapy Selection™ test overcomes previous biological and clinical barriers to personalized cancer therapy. Past efforts have focused on measuring cell death, a process that can take over a week and has shown no sustainable clinical success. Since a cell’s weight change ex vivo happens in hours, we eliminate the difficulty of having to distinguish between natural cell death and cell death induced by a cancer drug. Preliminary studies have shown that Travera’s Rapid Therapy Selection™ test applies to many different cancer drugs with different mechanisms of action across 90% of cancers.
