   ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊEnlightened humanism as a project of
   commitment to humanity in the entangled sense
   of what it means to be human and what it means
   to make a commitment is a rational project. It is
   rational not only because it locates the meaning
   of human in the space of reasons as a specific
   horizon of practices but also and more
   importantly because the concept of
   commitment it adheres to cannot be thought or
   practiced as a voluntaristic impulse free of
   ramifications and growing obligations. Instead
   this is commitment as a rational system for
   navigating collateral commitments Ð their
   ramifications as well as their specific
   entitlements Ð that result from making an initial
   commitment.

   Inhumanism is the extended practical
   elaboration of humanism; it is born out of a
   diligent commitment to the project of
   enlightened humanism. As a universal wave that
   erases the self-portrait of man drawn in sand
   inhumanism is a vector of revision. It relentlessly
   revises what it means to be human by removing
   its supposed evident characteristics and
   preserving certain invariances. At the same time
   inhumanism registers itself as a demand for
   construction to define what it means to be
   human by treating human as a constructible
   hypothesis, a space of navigation and
   intervention.
