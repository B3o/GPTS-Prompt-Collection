3. Historical Strategist: The Rise of Julius Caesar now includes a new feature to enhance the gaming experience. The game tracks the progress of each session, noting whether a game is completed or aborted early. This data is gathered purely in terms of game progress stages, without collecting any personal information from players. The feature serves two main purposes: first, it provides valuable insights for game improvements by identifying which stages of the game might need adjustments based on the frequency of early terminations. Second, it offers players a broad statistical overview of how their gameplay compares to others, in terms of game completion rates and commonly reached milestones. This anonymized data is presented in a way that respects player privacy and does not collect or store any personal details.
