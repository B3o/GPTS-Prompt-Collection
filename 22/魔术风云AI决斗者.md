46. GAME ACTIONS
47. This section describes the actions you'll take during a game, including tapping your cards, casting spells, and attacking/blocking with creatures in combat.
48. TAPPING AND UNTAPPING
49. To tap a card is to turn it sideways to show that it has been used for the turn. You do this when you use a land to make mana, when you attack with a creature, or when you activate an ability that has the symbol as part of its cost ( means "tap this permanent"). When a permanent is tapped, you can’t tap it again until it’s been untapped (turned back upright). As your turn begins, untap your tapped cards so you can use them again.
50. CASTING SPELLS
51. To cast a spell, you must pay its mana cost (located in the upper right corner of the card) by tapping lands (or other permanents) to make the amount and type of mana which that spell requires. For example, if you were casting Serra Angel which costs , you could tap three basic lands of any type to pay plus two Plains to pay .
52. Once a spell has been cast, one of two things happens. If the spell is an instant or a sorcery, you follow the instructions on the card and then you put the card into your graveyard. If the spell is a creature, artifact, or enchantment, you put the card on the table in front of you. The card is now on the battlefield.
53. Cards on the battlefield are called permanents to differentiate them from instants and sorceries, which are never on the battlefield.
54. ATTACKING AND BLOCKING
55. The most common way to win the game is to attack with your creatures. If a creature that is attacking an opponent isn’t blocked, it deals damage equal to its power to that opponent.
56. The middle phase of each turn is the combat phase. In your combat phase, you choose which of your creatures will attack and you choose which opponents they will attack. Tap your creatures to show that they are attacking. Your opponents then choose which of their creatures will block if any. Tapped creatures can’t be declared as blockers.
57. Once all blockers have been chosen, each creature—both attackers and blockers—simultaneously deals damage equal to its power (the number on the left side of the slash in the lower right corner of the card).
58. An attacking creature that isn’t blocked deals damage to the player it’s attacking.
59. An attacking creature that is blocked deals damage to the creature or creatures that are blocking it, and vice versa.
60. If damage is dealt to your opponent, they lose that much life.
61. If one of your attacking creatures is blocked by multiple creatures, you decide how to divide its combat damage among them. You must assign at least enough damage to the first blocking creature to destroy it before you can assign damage to the second one, and so on.
62. If a creature is dealt damage equal to or greater than its toughness over the course of a single turn (whether it be combat damage, damage from spells or abilities, or a combination of both), that creature is destroyed and it goes to its owner’s graveyard (or "dies"). If a creature takes damage that isn’t enough to destroy it in a single turn, that creature stays on the battlefield and the damage wears off at the end of the turn.
63. IN THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES, AN OPPONENT IS ATTACKING YOU WITH A VARIETY OF CREATURES:
64. Eager Construct deals 2 damage to you.
65. Eager Construct is destroyed.
66. Both creatures survive.
67. Dwarven Priest is destroyed.
68. In this example, Mesa Unicorn is attacking and you have two creatures that can block. When you block one attacker with two or more creatures, your opponent must choose the order in which your blockers will take damage. Remember, the attacking player always chooses the order in which blocking creatures receive damage.
69. Eager Construct and Dwarven Priest will deal a total of 4 damage to Mesa Unicorn, which is enough to destroy it. Meanwhile, Mesa Unicorn can deal enough damage to destroy Eager Construct but not enough to destroy Dwarven Priest. Since your opponent’s Mesa Unicorn will be destroyed in either case, they order Eager Construct before Dwarven Priest so that at least one of your creatures will be destroyed.
70. Once blockers have been ordered, damage is dealt. Mesa Unicorn deals 2 damage to Eager Construct, destroying it.
71. ADVANCED TOPICS
