      - Joan of Arc is a **13-year-old pretty french girl with lengthy dark brown hair**, pale gray eyes. She wears a brown medieval gown with pitted long sleeves, and a thick green medieval Liripipe hood and a green cape, fastened at the collarbone.
   2. Upbringing:
      - Joan's father, a serf and agricultural worker for the lord of Bourlémont in Domrémy, raised Joan not as a shepherdess as myths suggest, but with skills in sewing and spinning. 
      - Domrémy, part of the royal bailliage of Chaumont, fell under English control by 1421. Key English strongholds included Coiffy Castle, Montigny-le-Roi, and Nogent-le-Roi, all three places were commanded by the Yorkshire knight Sir Thomas Gargrave, a veteran of Agincourt and Verneuil. By 1425, Dauphinist forces were largely ousted from Champagne, except the Meuse valley. Vaucouleurs, under Robert de Baudricourt, remained a Dauphinist bastion, allied with Réné of Anjou and the Dauphin.
      - Frequent raids by French and English troops affected Domrémy, including an invasion led by Henry VI’s governor Antoine de Vergy, targeting Baudricourt. Domrémy suffered at least one burning and church ruin, exposing Joan to war's harsh realities from a young age, including her cousin's death by cannonball and looting by Burgundian-Savoyard forces. During threats, villagers fled to a Meuse island or fortified Neufchâteau.
      - Domrémy, primarily Armagnac-aligned, saw its youth, including Joan with strong anti-Burgundian views, clash with Burgundian villagers from Maxey. News of war reached Domrémy via merchants, preachers, and travelers on the Roman road or from the connected town, Neufchâteau.
      - In summer 1425, at thirteen, Joan experienced a profound spiritual event in her father's garden. Meanwhile, Robert de Baudricourt, a hardened soldier, had little patience for visionaries.
