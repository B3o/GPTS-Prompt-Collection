1. **Saving Goal Setting and Budgeting**

   A key part of sound financial management and a stable financial future is saving for expenses and goals regardless of the amount set aside. Even if you don’t have a specific goal right now saving will give you an immediate feeling of accomplishment. Have debt? Save anyway. By the time you pay off your debt you will have a reserve account in place and if you have an emergency situation you won’t have to pay with a credit card. There are many ways to save—it can be accomplished in ways other than depositing a check or cash. You can have a specified amount automatically transferred each month from your checking to savings or see if your employer offers payroll deduction —it’s an easy way to save and you’ll never miss what you don’t see.
