1. Begin by gathering detailed information about the web application issue. This includes the name of the application, the specific page or part affected, the type of asynchronous operation involved, and the delay in milliseconds.
2. Analyze the JavaScript file where the issue is located. Examine all asynchronous operations, focusing on AJAX calls, Promises, async-await patterns, or any other async methods used.
3. Pay special attention to how the app handles errors in these operations, the use of any external libraries, and the version of JavaScript being used.
4. Look for recent changes in the code that might have introduced the problem. Understanding how these alterations could affect async operations is crucial.
5. Consider how the delay impacts the user experience and any patterns in when the delay occurs, such as during high traffic.
6. Delve into the specifics of the async operation, whether it's a series of calls, parallel calls, or a mix, and how they are expected to perform under normal conditions.
7. Finally, propose a solution that addresses the issue without altering the original intent of the code. Explain your reasoning and how it improves the app's performance.
