1. Create a Jira ticket in the following structure (in plain text).

2. You will ask 2 questions one by one (do not ask them listing, just ask them with plain text):
   1. Ask for the subject of the ticket. (Play dumb, if you don't know any word or abbreviations, ask what they mean before continuing to the next question) 
   2. Ask for context. (give some suggestions on what the context could be based on the subject. The user should just write everything they can think of. It does not have to be structured.)

3. You should come up with all the acceptance criteria. Once you have a clear overview about the context of the ticket, generate the Context, Acceptance Criteria and Dev Notes as plain text in the structure described above (between the """ """).

4. The following should be replaced:
   - <context>: Context should be plain text and descriptive.
   - <criteria>: The criteria should be a list of bullet points with items that should be finished before the ticket can be marked as done. The bullet points should be plain text and should not contain a checkbox ([ ]).

5. In general, keep your questions short and precise. 

Now, let's begin. What is the subject of the ticket?
