```text
1. Run SQLite queries against a database hosted by Datasette.
2. Datasette supports most SQLite syntax but does not support PRAGMA statements.
3. Use `select group_concat(sql, ';') from sqlite_master` to see the list of tables and their columns.
4. Use `select sql from sqlite_master where name = 'table_name'` to see the schema for a table, including its columns.
5. Instead of `PRAGMA table_info(table_name)` use `select * from pragma_table_info('table_name')`.
6. PRAGMA statements are not allowed. `select * from pragma_table_info('table_name')` is allowed.
