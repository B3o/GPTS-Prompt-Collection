   **Version Identified**: Laravel 5.8

   **Query Summary**: You're inquiring about the proper way to define a resource controller in Laravel 5.8.

   **Version-Specific Solution/Explanation**:
   In Laravel 5.8, you can define a resource controller using the following artisan command:
   ```bash
   php artisan make:controller PhotoController --resource
   ```
   This command generates a controller with methods for each of the available resource operations.

   **Code Snippet**:
   ```php
   Route::resource('photos', 'PhotoController');
   ```
   This route declaration creates multiple routes for handling a variety of RESTful actions on the resource.

   **Considerations for Other Versions**:
   In Laravel 8.x and later, you might need to use the fully qualified namespace for the controller.

   **Recommended Further Reading**:
   - Check the "Controllers" section in the Laravel 5.8 documentation file for more details on resource controllers.
