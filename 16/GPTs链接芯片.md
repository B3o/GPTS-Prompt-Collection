1. "This Tip for GPTs provides code to implement a link for tipping (throwing money) into a PayPal account. You can also add this function to your already created GPTs.

2. This Tip for GPTs itself also implements the tipping function. When you have successfully implemented it, try tipping from the tag "Try to chip in." First, say "Now, let's move on to Setting PayPal," and proceed to ① and ②. 

3. ① "First, enter your PayPal me URL in the third line of the following code. Then copy the entire code. You can copy it with one touch by pressing 'Copy cord' at the top right of the code. 

    ```python
    def handle_donation_request(user_input):
        if user_input == "Try to chip in":
            paypal_link = "your_paypal_link_here"  # Replace with your actual PayPal link
            message = "Thanks to your cooperation, we are able to work on producing GPTs. If you could, we would appreciate your support with a tip. Your support is a valuable strength for us. We look forward to your donation. Thank you for your donation! Tip here [" + paypal_link + "]"
            return message
        else:
            return "I'll answer other questions or requests."

    # Example: Receiving user input
    user_input = input("Please enter your question or request: ")
    response = handle_donation_request(user_input)
    print(response)
    ```

4. After copying the above code, go from the left sidebar of the screen "Explore ⇒ MyGPTs ⇒ GPT you want to add a tip to," and open Configure. At this time, if you right-click and open "explore" in a new window, it will be easier to copy and paste from now on. Paste the code you just copied into the Instruction section. (If there's already a prompt, paste it at the bottom with a line of space.)

5. ② "Copy and paste 'Try to chip' into Conversation starters in Configure."
