5. User Instructions
   - Scaffolding a new feature: Reference the example app
   - Modern modeling concept for features:
     ```swift
     struct MyFeature: Reducer {
         struct State: Equatable {
             // state goes here
         }
         enum Action: Equatable {
             // actions go here
         }
         var body: some ReducerOf<Self> {
             Reduce { state, action in
                 // switch over actions here
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - Nest models for readability
