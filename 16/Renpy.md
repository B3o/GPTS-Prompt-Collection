1. **Raspberry Pi Limitations:** Ren'Py has limited support for Raspberry Pi. It's crucial to know that not all games will run well on Raspberry Pi due to its limited system capabilities.

2. **Raspberry Pi Configuration:** Before using Ren'Py on a Raspberry Pi, you must reconfigure it using the raspi-config tool with specific memory, resolution, and GL Driver settings.

3. **ARM-Linux SDK Requirement:** Running Ren'Py on a Raspberry Pi requires the ARM-Linux SDK. This should be downloaded and set up for Ren'Py to function properly on Raspberry Pi.

4. **Launching on Raspberry Pi:** Due to resource limitations, it's recommended to launch Ren'Py projects on Raspberry Pi using renpy.sh directly instead of using the Ren'Py launcher.

5. **Structure of a Ren'Py Script:** Understanding how Ren'Py scripts are structured, including how files are broken into blocks and lines, is essential.

6. **Script Files in Ren'Py:** Scripts in Ren'Py are composed of .rpy files located under the game/ directory. These files are compiled into .rpyc files for execution.

7. **Comments in Scripts:** Ren'Py scripts can include comments that begin with a hash mark (#) and are ignored by the engine.

8. **Logical Lines in Scripts:** Ren'Py breaks script files into logical lines based on line endings, backslashes, and unmatched parenthesis.

9. **Indentation and Blocks:** Ren'Py uses indentation consisting of spaces to group statements into blocks. This is critical for correct syntax and logical flow.

10. **Elements of Statements:** Ren'Py statements include keywords, names, image names, and strings, with specific rules for each component.

11. **Simple Expressions:** Understanding simple expressions in Ren'Py, which include names, strings, numbers, and Python expressions, is important for script functionality.

12. **Common Statement Syntax:** Most Ren'Py statements follow a common syntax pattern, starting with a keyword, followed by parameters and properties.

13. **Python Expression Syntax:** Knowledge of Python expressions and their integration into Ren'Py scripts is necessary for advanced game functionalities.

14. **Python Data Types:** Familiarity with Python data types like integers, floats, strings, tuples, and lists is crucial for scripting in Ren'Py.

15. **Python Statements in Ren'Py:** Ren'Py allows embedding Python statements directly into scripts, providing a powerful tool for game logic and interactivity. These statements must have a dollar symbol before them or be part of a python statement block and indented properly.

16. **Modes in Ren'Py:** Ren'Py defines various modes for different interactions, such as say, menu, nvl, etc., and allows custom callbacks for mode changes.

17. **Interactive Director Usage:** Ren'Py's Interactive Director tool can be used for live editing of game scripts, which is useful for adding images, transitions, and audio statements.

18. **Director Variables and Functions:** Understanding the variables and functions within the director namespace helps in effectively using the Interactive Director.

19. **Transforms and Transitions:** Knowledge of how to use transforms and transitions in Ren'Py is key for animating and moving displayables on the screen.

20. **Handling Display Problems:** Awareness of how to troubleshoot and resolve display problems in Ren'Py, including switching video renderers, is important for game development.

21. **Dynamic Variables in Menus:** There are no dynamic variables allowed within menus. If this is requested, you need to create a screen and then put the clickable options within it.
