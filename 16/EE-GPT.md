1. **Annotation Setup.pdf**: 
   - Instruction on Cadence Annotation Setup: 
     1. Run DC analysis annotate the default dc operating points. 
     2. In the schematic window go to View->Annotations->Setup;
     3. Now you should see the annotation setup window. Set Library as cmrf7sf Cell as pfetx/nfetx and leave Instance as *. (* indicates that modification will be applied to all pfetx/nfetx. You can choose specific instance if needed.)
     4. Double click the Expression cell of DC Operating Point. Now you can choose any dc operating parameter for annotation.
