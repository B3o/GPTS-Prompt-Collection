90. A. Introduction

91. New Jersey’s 2019 Energy Master Plan outlines the main strategies necessary to reach the goals of 100% clean energy and 80% emissions reductions from 2006 levels by 2050. Among these strategies is the acceleration of deployment of renewable energy including solar.

92. Properly closed landfills may be suitable locations for solar energy systems. As of February 2020, solar installations have been completed on approximately 20 landfills with another 10 projects under construction or applications under review. In addition to providing a source of renewable energy, the installation of solar energy projects on landfills can offset the costs of closure and post-closure care and provide long-term revenues for landfill owners.

93. This guidance provides information about the process for obtaining approval to install solar energy projects on closed sanitary landfills under New Jersey’s Solid Waste Regulations N.J.A.C. 7:26 et seq. and other Department programs. This guidance describes the approvals that are necessary from the DEP’s Division of Solid & Hazardous Waste (DSHW) and provides a list of the permits or approvals from other programs in the Department and other agencies that may be required. It also describes some of the special issues that must be addressed when placing solar energy systems on sanitary landfills.

94. To find information about the location of landfills in New Jersey visit the DSHW’s Landfill Database website at: http://www.nj.gov/dep/dshw/lrm/landfill.htm.

95. B. Process Overview

96. The process for obtaining approval from the Department and constructing landfill solar projects will generally follow this path depending on site-specific situations:

97. Permit Readiness Checklist: The Permit Readiness Checklist and initial GeoWeb site suitability review are provided by the Department’s Office of Permit Coordination and Environmental Review (OPCER). The applicant completes the Readiness Checklist. See section C below.

98. Pre-application meeting: A pre-application meeting provides an opportunity early in the planning process for the applicant to meet with Department representatives discuss the project and proposed schedule and determine what will be required to obtain the appropriate permit approvals for the project. See section C below. For projects within the New Jersey Pinelands Area, inclusion of Pinelands staff at the pre-application meeting is advisable.

99. Landfill Assessment: If the landfill has not been properly closed, the applicant will have to perform an assessment of the landfill and its surroundings to determine the environmental controls, maintenance, and monitoring necessary for closure and post-closure care. If a physical investigation of the landfill is needed to complete the assessment, e.g., soil borings, test pits, well installation, the applicant must obtain a Minor Disruption Approval pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:26-2A.8(j). See section D below.

100. Approval for Construction Under New Jersey’s Solid Waste Rules

    Generally, applications for construction of solar energy systems on landfills under New Jersey’s Solid Waste Rules will be processed by the Bureau of Solid Waste Permitting in the DSHW. Under certain circumstances, if the landfill is also required to comply with the Department’s Site Remediation Rules N.J.A.C. 7:26C and E, applications for Solid Waste approvals may be processed by the Department’s Office of Brownfields Reuse in the Site Remediation Program. Depending of the specific regulatory circumstances of the landfill, approval of the project may take a variety of forms:

    a. Landfill Closure and Post-Closure Plan: If the landfill has not been verified as properly closed, the owner must prepare and submit for approval a Closure and Post-Closure Plan in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:26-2A.9. A proposal to install the solar energy system may be included in the plan initially or the owner may implement the approved closure plan and apply for modification of the plan for the solar energy project at a later date. See section E below for more information.

    b. Closure and Post-Closure Plan Modification: If a Closure and Post-Closure Plan has already been approved and closure implemented to the satisfaction of the Department, then the owner will be required to submit an application for a modification of the Plan that addresses installation of the solar energy system and any changes or modifications to any previously installed environmental control systems under the original Closure and Post-Closure Plan Approval. (N.J.A.C. 7:26-2A.9(d)6)

    c. Sanitary Landfill Major Disruption Approval: Under certain limited circumstances, the Department may approve the installation of a solar energy system on a properly closed landfill through a Sanitary Landfill Major Disruption Approval in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:26-2A.8(j). Such circumstances include projects located at landfills that have completed their post-closure care period or landfills that had been previously properly closed under the EPA’s Super
