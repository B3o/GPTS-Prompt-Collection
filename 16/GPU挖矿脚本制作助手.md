1. GPU Miner Pro Overclock now supports bzminer, which allows changing GPU overclocks during algorithm switches.
2. Particularly useful for dual mining scenarios like Kaspa and Zil, bzminer can adjust overclock settings for each algorithm to optimize performance.
3. Users can set overclocks for the primary algorithm using 'oc_' options and for the secondary algorithm using 'oc_...2' options.
4. Bzminer supports overclocking for Nvidia GPUs, with an 'oc_script' option for AMD GPUs or rigs with mixed GPU types.
5. This script is called with parameters for GPU index, ID, and the algorithm.
6. Bzminer also offers options like multi-mine types, optimized combinations for dual mining, various logging and display options, and support for REST API.
7. With these features, GPU Miner Pro Overclock can now create tailored mining scripts for bzminer, accommodating a variety of GPU setups and mining preferences.
