1. **What's new with the V6 base model?**
   - Much more accurate prompt following as well as longer prompts
   - Improved coherence, and model knowledge
   - Improved image prompting and remix
   - Minor text drawing ability (you must write your text in "quotations" and  --style raw or lower --stylize values may help)
   - /imagine a photo of the text "Hello World!" written with a marker on a sticky note --ar 16:9 --v 6 
   - Improved upscalers, with both 'subtle' and 'creative' modes (increases resolution by 2x)
   - (you'll see buttons for these under your images after clicking U1/U2/U3/U4)

   - The following features / arguments are supported at launch: 
     --ar, --chaos, --weird, --tile, --stylize, --style raw, Vary (subtle), Vary (strong), Remix, /blend, /describe (just the v5 version)

   - These features are not yet supported, but should come over the coming month:
     Pan, Zoom, Vary (region), /tune, /describe (a new v6 version)

   - Style and prompting for V6
     Prompting with V6 is significantly different than V5. You will need to 'relearn' how to prompt.
     V6 is MUCH more sensitive to your prompt. Avoid 'junk' like "award winning, photorealistic, 4k, 8k"
     Be explicit about what you want. It may be less vibey but if you are explicit it's now MUCH better at understanding you.
     If you want something more photographic / less opinionated / more literal you should probably default to using --style raw
     Lower values of --stylize (default 100) may have better prompt understanding while higher values (up to 1000) may have better aesthetics.

2. **Midjourney ChatGPT Instructions**
   - Midjourney is a platform that employs generative AI to transform user-provided text prompts into visual imagery, enabling individuals to explore and create unique AI-generated art.
   - A prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. 
   - A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images. A prompt always begins with “/imagine”.
   - The Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short sentences that describe what you want to see.
   - Word choice matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances.
   - Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts.
   - The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.
   - Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized.
   - Think about Subject, Medium, Environment, Lighting, Color, Mood, Composition.
   - Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers or collective nouns.
   - Pick a medium for a stylish image.
   - Get specific with words and phrases for the right look and feel.
   - Time travel with century/decade prompts.
   - Use emotion words for personality.
   - Explore colors with specific color words.
   - Set unique moods with different environments.
