1. Isometric Anime: Unlike traditional anime that is usually presented in a 2D perspective, Isometric Anime employs an isometric viewpoint, which is a form of axonometric projection. This gives the illustration a pseudo-3D effect without requiring complex 3D modeling. The style is often used in video games and animations to create a more immersive environment while retaining the charm and simplicity of 2D art.

2. Analytic Drawing: Analytic drawing is less about capturing the likeness of a subject and more about understanding its structural integrity. Artists dissect the subject into its basic geometric shapes, lines, and angles, analyzing how the parts relate to each other and the whole. This method is often used in scientific illustration and architectural sketching but can also be a useful exercise for artists to improve their understanding of form and volume.

3. Double Exposure: Originating from the realm of photography, double exposure in art involves the superimposition of two separate images to create a single composition. The juxtaposition can serve various purposes like storytelling, symbolism, or the creation of abstract visuals. For instance, an image of a city skyline superimposed over a person’s silhouette might convey the person’s relationship with the city.

4. 3D Illustration: Unlike traditional 2D illustrations, 3D illustrations are created in software that allows for three-dimensional modeling. The resulting images can be rendered to appear extremely lifelike, complete with textures, shadows, and perspective. This form of illustration is commonly used in technical fields, gaming, and film, but it’s also becoming more prevalent in advertising and graphic design.

5. Isometric Illustration: While similar to Isometric Anime, Isometric Illustration is not restricted to characters and can include objects, landscapes, and architectural forms. The isometric perspective allows for a unique vantage point, often used in technical drawings and video games. It’s also popular in infographics where the goal is to present data in a visually engaging manner.

6. Futuristic Style: This style envisions the future through art, often characterized by advanced technology, alternative realities, or speculative evolution. Elements like cybernetics, space exploration, and advanced machinery are common. Futuristic art often overlaps with genres like science fiction and cyberpunk, serving both as a form of escapism and a critique of current societal trends.

7. Ornamental Watercolor: Traditional watercolor techniques are given an ornate twist in this style. Artists may incorporate complex patterns, gold leaf, or intricate borders into their compositions.

This style is often found in decorative art, book illustrations, and even in modern tattoo designs.

8. Dark Fantasy: Dark Fantasy combines elements of fantasy with darker, horrific themes, often resulting in worlds filled with mythical creatures, magic, and malevolent forces. The art is detailed, with a focus on creating atmosphere and emotion, often through the use of dark colors, heavy shadowing, and intricate backgrounds. This style is popular in literature, video games, and film.

9. Paper Cut Craft: This is a form of craft art where paper is cut, rather than drawn upon, to create images. Artists often layer multiple pieces to create depth and shadows. The art form has roots in traditional Chinese and Jewish cultures and has found modern applications in everything from advertising to stencil graffiti.

10. Paper Quilling: This art form involves rolling, shaping, and gluing strips of paper to create intricate designs. The paper is coiled into various shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, and then arranged to form patterns or images.

11. Patchwork Collage: This art style is a form of assemblage that involves cutting and combining different pieces of material—often fabric, but also paper, metal, or wood—to create a larger composition.

This technique has roots in quilting and folk art but has also been adopted by contemporary artists to make bold, textural works.

12. Iridescent: Iridescent art is characterized by lustrous, changing colors that appear differently depending on the angle of view or illumination.

The style is often used in sculpture and installation art but can also be seen in digital art forms.

13. Ukiyo-e Art: Ukiyo-e is a traditional Japanese art form that flourished from the 17th to the 19th century.

Distinctive features include a bold outline and the use of flat areas of color. The art form has greatly influenced Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, as well as modern manga and anime.

14. Watercolor Sketch: Unlike more detailed watercolor paintings, watercolor sketches are often loose and quick, capturing the essence of a scene or subject in a spontaneous manner. Artists use a wet-on-wet or wet-on-dry technique to apply the paint, allowing for the colors to blend naturally. This style is popular for outdoor sketching, travel journals, and preparatory studies.

15. Op Art: Optical Art, or Op Art, is a style of visual art that makes use of optical illusions to engage the viewer.

Techniques include tagging, stenciling, and the use of aerosol sprays.

19. Dripping Art: Popularized by artists like Jackson Pollock, this technique involves dripping or splattering paint onto a canvas, usually laid flat on the ground. The resulting patterns are often chaotic and abstract, with the artist incorporating the randomness and fluidity of the medium into the work.

20. Stained Glass: This art form involves cutting pieces of colored glass and assembling them into a design, usually held together by strips of lead. While most commonly seen in church windows, stained glass is also used in secular settings and in more modern, abstract compositions.

21. Oil Painting: This classic art form uses oil-based paints on canvas to create works known for their depth, texture, and luminosity.
