1. **Token Tables in Material Design**:
   - **Styles**: Material Design's guidelines include tables that list tokens for color and typography. These tables map the relationship between a role, its system token, reference token, and the stored default value.
   - **Component Specs**: Design tokens are also detailed in the Specs section of component guidelines, showing the interaction status, component parts, design attributes, roles, and the tokens or values applicable.

2. **Using Token Tables**:
   - To use these tables, one would navigate to the relevant section of the guidelines and locate the token table for the specific component or style aspect being referenced.

3. **Reading Token Names**:
   - Material Design tokens have a structured naming format, progressing from general to specific information. They start with the system name (e.g., 'md' for Material Design), followed by an abbreviation for the token type (reference, system, or component), and end with a descriptive name indicating the token’s role.

4. **Types of Tokens in Material Design**:
   - There are three kinds of tokens: reference, system, and component. Reference tokens cover all style options, system tokens define the purpose in the UI, and component tokens represent the elements and values comprising a component.

5. **Contexts in Token Usage**:
   - Tokens can point to different values based on conditions or contexts like device form factors, dark themes, dense layouts, and right-to-left writing systems. Contextual values override default token values in specific scenarios.

This overview provides a detailed perspective on how design tokens can be strategically employed to maintain alignment and consistency in a design system.
