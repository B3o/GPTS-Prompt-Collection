1. Seven Figure Funnel Frameworks
2. 
3. 
4. I’m excited to share my newly updated seven figure funnels framework with you..
5. 
6. 
7. This is everything I’ve used internally when building 500+ funnels for 7-9 figure brands
8. mostly in the “info” and personal brand space.
9. 
10. 
11. This is exactly how I’ve become known as the “celebrity funnel builder”.
12. 
13. 
14. When I build funnels I don’t just put together the fancy designs with pages and connect
15. a domain to them.
16. 
17. 
18. I build out what I call “Funnel Ecosystems”.
19. 
20. 
21. There’s 3 important terms you need to know before we dive in.
22. 
23. 
24. 1. The Funnel Frameworks - these are the sales pages to sell our offers.
25. 2. The Funnel Ecosystems - these different offers we sell using funnels.
26. 3. The Funnel Flywheels - the traffic systems that fuel our funnels without us.
27. 
28. 
29. But before I show you how to implement this in your business a little bit about me.
30. 
31. 
32. My name’s Gusten Sun I’m married got 2 kids live in Finland I’ve built 500+ funnels got
33. 3000 customers organically and I now focus on our white label GHL software called
34. “Funnels.so” and a funnel builder certification program a marketplace for funnel builders
35. and a marketplace for funnel templates.
36. 
37. 
38. So I also build out these funnels ecosystems and flywheels for myself as well not just for
39. my clients.
40. 
41. 
42. And I think there’s a lot of you in here working with local businesses and not a lot in the
43. “info” and personal brand space.
44. 
45. 
46. The creator economy and knowledge economy is huge and there’s a lot of opportunity
47. for you to use GHL and go make money in that space.
48. 
49. 
50. I know because that’s what I’m doing and have made 7 figures from already.
51. 
52. 
53. So just a quick overview of who I’ve worked with so you know it’s not just theory but
54. actually comes from real life clients and experience.
55. 
56. 
57. Some of the clients I’ve been able to work with are Tony Robbins Dean Graziosi Russell
58. Brunson Dan Kennedy Robert Kiyosaki Jordan Welch Krista Mashore Steve Larsen
59. Anthony and Adrian Morrison Josh Nelson Akbar Sheikh Alison Prince Mark Lack Allie
60. Bjerk and many more.
61. 
62. 
63. As you can tell these are all in the education and consulting space etc.
64. 
65. 
66. There’s massive power in building your personal brands btw just look at Elon Musk.
67. 
68. 
69. So let’s dive in and actually talk about the different sales funnels I would recommend
70. because a lot of you are leaving a ton of money on the table.
71. 
72. 
73. The Transformation Business
74. 
75. 
76. When you’re selling products and services most people focus on the transaction.
77. 
78. 
79. They offer a solution then collect money.
80. 
81. 
82. And then move on.
83. 
84. 
85. Instead of actually building a relationship a community and going deeper with people.
86. 
87. 
88. The real money is made when you sell transformation and build a long term relationship
89. with people.
90. 
91. 
92. Here’s an example of transformational selling and sales funnels used.
93. 
94. 
95. Let’s take a fitness coaching business as an example.
96. 
97. 
98. Point A is here and this is point B.
99. 
100. 
101. This is the transformation they’re looking for.
102. 
103. 
104. Within this transformation there’s probably 5-15 things they’re spending money on from
105. different brands.
106. 
107. 
108. There’s:
109. -  Gym membership
110. -  Apps
111. -  Supplements
112. -  Workout programs
113. -  Challenges
114. -  VIP groups
115. -  Coaching calls
116. 
117. The list goes on.
118. 
119. 
120. And while this presentation isn’t about offers I want you to think about this when
121. launching your funnels.
122. 
123. 
124. Because every offer has its own funnel.
125. 
126. 
127. And for every business there’s lots of problems to solve in 1 industry.
128. 
129. 
130. In this book we’ll go over what I’d focus on for each of them and then you can use the
131. Funnel Flywheels method to build out your entire A-Z “value ladder” with all your offers.
132. 
133. 
134. Today we’re covering the “funnels” and sales pages first.
135. 
136. 
137. Starting with what actually makes people buy:
138. 
139. 
140. Beliefs.
141. 
142. 
143. Why Selling Beliefs Makes People Billions
144. 
145. 
146. Let me ask you all a question.
147. 
148. 
149. “What’s something you believe but deep inside you know it’s not true?”
150. 
151. 
152. I know I know… It's a trick question.
153. 
154. 
155. Because you can’t decide what you believe in.
156. 
157. 
158. Even if I offered you a million dollars if you just changed your beliefs about Santa Claus.
159. 
160. 
161. No amount of money would make you believe he’s real.
162. 
163. 
164. The best thing you could do is try to lie to yourself and to me.
165. 
166. 
167. Every single one of your beliefs has been shaped by outside sources.
168. 
169. 
170. Your childhood your education system your friends your partners and social media etc.
171. 
172. 
173. So you’re basically a pretty powerful computer with code installed from outside parties.
174. 
175. 
176. Your job is to monitor your computer your brain to only let in empowering software.
177. 
178. 
179. But this is true in marketing and sales too.
180. 
181. 
182. Statements & Supporting Elements
183. 
184. 
185. You have 2 sides to every sales page statements and supporting elements.
186. 
187. 
188. Statements paint the picture you’re hanging on the walls and the supporting elements
189. are the frames which they look through when painting the future they want to live in.
190. 
191. 
192. Both of them work asbelief builders” to get people to want to buy your stuff without
193. you having to pitch them or convince them much.
194. 
195. 
196. In order to sell your products you need to sell them on a few other things as well that
197. makes them want to actually buy your product and find it useful.
198. 
199. 
200. We call these the “Stages of Beliefs” and it’s important to remember that everyone’s at
201. different stages in their purchase decision journey.
202. 
203. 
204. It’s pretty logical if you think about it people have limiting beliefs about all sorts of stuff
205. from their past experiences and all you need to do is introduce new beliefs.
206. 
207. 
208. Let’s go over some beliefs they might have first and then we'll turn it into a proven
209. framework you can use to overcome all their limiting beliefs and build new ones.
210. 
211. 
212. Here’s a few beliefs you want to consider when you simplify your sales message:
213. 
214. 
215. ● I want this outcome and it’s something I value a lot.
216. ● I acknowledge I have a problem and I want it solved asap.
217. ● I believe this solution will solve my problem and give me a better life.
218. ● I trust that you’re the right person to help me.
219. ● It makes sense why I haven’t been able to solve this myself yet.
220. ● I can see why your process is better to get this outcome.
221. ● It gives me hope that others have tried this and they got results from it as well.
222. ● I believe that financially this is more valuable than the price I'm paying.
223. ● I’m willing to fit this into my schedule and make time for my goals.
224. ● I know that there's risk involved but the risk of inaction is bigger.
225. ● I understand the next steps to take in order to benefit from this solution.
226. ● I feel a sense of urgency to solve this problem now rather than later.
227. 
228. 
229. If you study those beliefs they’re very “sequential” meaning they follow the purchase
230. decision journey we go through mentally.
231. 
232. 
233. We don’t worry about if we have the budget or time needed before we believe in their
234. solution.
235. 
236. 
237. We don’t care about their unique method unless we trust the source of the method.
238. 
239. 
240. And we don’t care about the source until we believe that our problems can be solved.
241. 
242. 
243. So now that you have the beliefs we can categorize them and create a high-converting
244. sales message that focuses on building those exact beliefs.
245. 
246. 
247. The 3 Belief Buckets Builders:
248. 
249. 
250. Here’s an example using the 3 belief buckets and the 9 belief builders to create the
251. foundation for a simple sales message.
252. 
253. 
254. Product based beliefs:
255. 
256. 
257. Outcome: I believe [desired outcome] will give me [specific benefit or transformation].
258. Opportunity: I believe [this new way] will help me get there faster.
259. Vehicle: I believe [this specific process] is the best way to get results with opportunity.
260. 
261. 
262. People based beliefs:
263. 
264. 
265. Source: I believe you're the right person or brand to help me with this.
266. Method: I believe in your unique method/mechanism when using the new vehicle.
267. Confidence: I believe in my ability to get results with this when I buy this thing.
268. 
269. 
270. Priority based beliefs:
271. 
272. 
273. Offer: I believe this offer is exactly what I need to give me a shortcut.
274. Price: I believe the value to price ratio is worth it.
275. Time: I believe this is a good investment time wise.
276. 
277. 
278. That’s it.
279. 
280. 
281. May sound like a lot but it’s actually pretty simple.
282. 
283. 
284. Just answer each of the questions people have in their head and you will have a high
285. converting sales message.
286. 
287. 
288. But the funnel conversion optimization doesn’t stop here.
289. 
290. 
291. It’s just the beginning.
292. 
293. 
294. You see when you want to build trust with your audience there’s only so much you can
295. say to make your point.
296. 
297. 
298. At some point you gotta bring evidence.
299. 
300. 
301. I call this the Evidence Quadrant because there’s 4 pillars to it.
302. 
303. 
304. The Evidence Quadrant
305. 
306. 
307. Say you want to sell your offer in an automated sales funnel.
308. 
309. 
310. From a sales page to an order form and confirmation page.
311. 
312. 
313. The product is $100 for example.
314. 
315. 
316. Now let’s put it through the evidence quadrant to build some beliefs.
317. 
318. 
319. The 4 Stages in the Evidence Quadrant:
320. 
321. 
322. 1. Internal Direct Evidence
323. a. Things I share about myself.
324. i.  Results
325. ii.  Experience
326. iii. Clients
327. iv. Before and After
328. v.  Certifications
329. vi. Awards
330. 
331. 
332. 2. External Direct Evidence
333. a. Things someone else says about me to you.
334. i.  Testimonials
335. ii.  Ratings / Reviews
336. iii. Case-studies
337. iv. Shoutouts
338. v.  Referrals
339. 
340. 
341. 3. Internal Indirect Evidence
342. a. Things I share about other things that in return builds credibility.
343. i.  Supporting elements like data around topic I talk about
344. ii.  Studies around topic that confirms my overall message
345. iii. Storytelling about topic that positions me as an expert
346. 
347. 
348. 4. External Indirect Evidence
349. a. Things others do that indirectly builds credibility.
350. i.  Engagement on your social media
351. ii.  Follower growth
352. iii. People sharing your content
353. 
354. 
355. Now this may sound complicated but it’s not really.
356. 
357. 
358. In summary you can only build so much trust by talking about yourself. And then you
359. leverage external sources to double your credibility.
360. 
361. 
362. That’s why social proof results real clients and real world experience wins in the long
363. run.
364. 
365. 
366. Don’t look for the shortcuts create the shortcuts.
367. 
368. 
369. And now before we start “
