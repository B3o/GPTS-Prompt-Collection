22. "hi everyone i'm shaylynn here with reelzy today i'm going to be talking about author media kits this is also sometimes known as a press kit your author media kit is basically your all-purpose tool for book publicity it's basically a straightforward way to interact with the press or anyone else who might be promoting your book such as bloggers reviewers podcasts and even bookstores basically it's an assortment of information and media for anyone who wants details about you and your book it's kind of like a dynamic interactive business card on your website basically you're going to assemble all the resources that a press outlet promoting your book might need and assemble them all in one place so they're easy to access this makes journalists or bloggers lives so much easier when working with you because you can just send them a link to your media kit rather than having to send them all the information individually which can turn into kind of a long back and forth thread nowadays media kits are pretty much all digital so you can just link them on your website with google drive or dropbox so what should you include in your media kit first of all is your bio you want to keep this fairly concise around 100 to 200 words and we've got an entire video on the topic so i'll leave a link to that for you to check out with your bio you also want to include a headshot author headshots don't have to be anything incredibly fancy many people even take them themselves but make sure it's a good resolution number two is your contact information this includes your full name email address links to your social media platforms and your agents or any other representatives names the next thing you'll need is a sample q a in order to put out a great interview you have to give journalists something to work with so in order to do this provide a tip sheet this is basically a document that offers a variety of discussion topics this makes it so much easier for anyone interviewing you they can look at this document and see your book's best talking points right away although this may kind of shatter the illusion the truth is that journalists don't always read your book when they interview you about it so provide them with seven to ten sample questions as well as sample answers plus these are questions you know you have effective and interesting answers to so you can produce the best interview possible the next thing you'll need is your press release this is the only time sensitive aspect of your media kit so make sure to update it after your book's release as the details start to change or no longer become relevant you're basically only going to need this part when you're first releasing your book the first thing you're going to need is a sample headline this is something that kind of sums up the message of the book in a catchy interesting way you want it to be attention-grabbing thought-provoking and appealing basically like the headline of an article that would be interesting enough for you to click on it next up you'll need a short synopsis this is a concise synopsis about your book that highlights why it's unique and why it will appeal to readers you can use comp titles here and focus on making it as interesting as possible next up you'll need contact details so basically what does a journalist or reviewer have to do to contact you learn more or get a review copy you can also include a cover image features angles so basically anything newsworthy about your book say it's based on a true story or something like that and the book's details so the publisher publication date price and where the book is sold i'll leave a link below to our blog post on media kits where you can take a look at some examples next up you'll need photographs include each image as a standalone jpeg in both high and low res formats you want to include your book's cover promotional photos of your book as well as your author headshot next up is a sell sheet this is basically like your media kits cheat sheet it's a one-page document with all your books details maybe even think of it as your book's resume it's there for any blogger retailer or journalist who kind of just wants the details straight up without having to sift through your entire media kit include your name the book's genre the book's price the page number isbn publication date synopsis available format retailers available territories sold in thumbnail of both the cover and your author photo and excerpts from testimonials and reviews and finally is your excerpt of course you don't want to include the whole book here just the first few pages should do but it should be enough to grab whoever's reading its attention so now that you've assembled your media kit here's what to do with it first of all make sure everything is formatted in a professional and aesthetically pleasing way then you can include it on your website either in your about me page or on a dedicated press page if you receive any queries from journalists or reviewers include a link to it in your initial email and make sure to label all the files properly so it's as easy to navigate and use as possible remember to keep it up to date as the information changes and if you need any more inspiration you can look at authors of similar titles to see how they format their media kits that's how to make an author media kit i'll leave some more resources in the description for you to check out both on media kits and just marketing in general thank you so much for watching
