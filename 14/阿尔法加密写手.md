   - **ABOUT About Alpha Stake:** Introducing Eric Kazee Alpha Stake’s General Partner and Fund Manger. 
   - Before 2017, Eric’s professional career involved independent consulting and training technology solutions to entities in legal, medical, and financial sectors. Eric also loved real estate investing, both hard and paper assets. While raising capital for a start-up business venture, Eric discovered the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) technique for funding a new venture. Although that period was problematic due to lack of regulations and guidance, a new paradigm was established for a new permissionless financial system with no boundaries and controlled by code. Thus, all other ventures were dropped, and Eric focused exclusively on the new and dynamically evolving cryptocurrency space. After years of experience and investing through several boom and bust crypto cycles, Eric now wants to share his wealth of knowledge with a select few who want privilege involvement in the most exciting new asset class.

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.” –Synopsys.com

11. **Video Script for Self Introduction**
    - Let me tell you a bit about myself. I started this crypto journey in 2017, self-taught; there was no formal education around this stuff. You pretty much had to source out whatever information you could and put in your 5000 hours of learning. But just as any investment market, it followed the same principles just at a 10x rate. I was used to investing before crypto; I like trading equities, indices, dabbled in a little forex, and loved the oil commodity trade. But this was different; instead of trading for pips and needing to put on large leverage, crypto offered incredible returns just for spot trading back then. Well, I explored every corner of the ecosystem from the original Bitcoin and its many forks, Ethereum’s smart contracts, many L1 competitors were burgeoning at this time; I explored cryptos with MasterNodes such as DASH; it was just an exciting and fascinating space. I guess so much of the ethos from the crypto-cyberpunk mentality aligned with my value systems. I liked the idea of self-sovereignty with my money and the comfort of security if anything were to go really bad with our financial system; there are alternative ways of trading and interacting beside physical items like gold. So I explored this space and came upon a realization for all the other businesses I was working on, other investments from real estate to the Nasdaq; nothing else was more important than this emerging sector. So I dropped everything and focused on crypto full time. That first year, it really paid off; that was the BTC all-time high of near $20k, and many of the alt-coins had even greater runs. Then came 2018 that drug into 2019; some great detailed lessons were learned during that time. The bear market will come, so pay attention and be prepared. I saw the benefits of stable coins for the first time. When all the annoying hype-men went away, and the fly by night projects disappeared, I noticed the true builders were still building. I made a decision during this time to keep my focus and commitment in digital assets because I believed in the potential, with evidence of what was accomplished. I knew more maturity was needed in the space, but I wanted to be there and follow the detailed path of this market’s development just as I saw the big silicon valley V.C.s do early in their career. I knew those who pay attention to developments and caught the waves as they come would be the biggest beneficiaries of this crypto Cambrian explosion. Now I’ve gone through several boom-bust cycles and even 2022. Despite the froth and the bad behavior that brings about downturns, my core thesis has never waivered. Blockchain technology will eat the world, and this space will iterate until every item, agreement, and even identity will be tokenized. There is no other way for the future to develop without it.
