Foreword

Every day business life involves making decisions based on evidence which in
turn allow the company (and all its employees) to move forward and make
further decisions. This approach known as a process chain has implications for the
long-term survival of a business. Such facts are compiled in a “company diagno-
sis”.
The concept of “diagnosis” can be explained simply: it is the production of
knowledge based on observation of the actual and available facts. The available data
is systematically analyzed in order to produce a coherent business strategy and to
determine the means to implement this strategy at the practical and operational level. 
Such diagnoses are based on relevant factors: political economic socio-cultural 
etc. However they are necessarily conducted at a specific point in time and can
therefore rapidly become outdated if the industry is dynamic. Further these
diagnoses usually rely on a set of facts (which are more or less accurate) opinions
(more or less valid) and a certain bias of analysis (even if everything possible is
done to limit this). Making a decision based on such a diagnosis alone may have
important and unintended consequences for the future of a company.
A company diagnosis is a necessary component of any business strategy. 
Nevertheless its importance must be put into perspective. On one hand economic
systems are dynamic and situations can change rapidly so the actors of these
systems must continually adapt themselves to the new conditions and adjust their
behaviour needs and expectations accordingly. On the other hand a manager cannot
be sure that the chosen solution will be the best one nor that the decision will be
good.

Foreword  

Strategy is by definition a dynamic domain. A situation can be approached from
multiple perspectives and there is not always one sole solution to an issue faced by
a company: numerous solutions may be possible each having its own strengths 
weaknesses and efficiency. Thus the diagnosis is just one element (among others) 
guiding the formation of a business strategy. This strategy aims to identify actions
that when implemented will facilitate the resolution of actual problems. Finally the
decision-making process is the result of a discipline of mind based on specific
thinking processes and mechanisms.
It is in this context that the case study method becomes relevant. Thismethod
allows the reader first to train him or herself to analyse situations and environments 
and secondly to develop these thought processes so as to enable proposals for action
in various areas of marketing which together help to reduce the uncertainty faced
by businesses.
The case studies examined in this book build on a diverse range of real life
situations and enable students to decide on action based on real information and
data. A case can be focused on a specific issue (whether technical human financial 
marketing competitive or industrial-related) but it is important to note at the outset
that no issue is ever really isolated from the other aspects of a company the situation
of a company being the result of the overall balance (or imbalance) of all its
services.
In practice the data available in a case study will never be complete and sufficient. 
Also not all information provided will necessarily be needed to resolve the case but
may be included so as to give a wider view of the company’s context and its
environment. Thus the reader is encouraged to learn about the company and the
relevant market to enable a comparison between the data provided and the data
gathered and compiled which will ensure the validity of the information and
improve the decisions taken. As in any real-life situation the proposals developed
must always take into account the human context within which the firm operates. 
One must also bear in mind that in business there are no ideal decisions only
reasonable solutions!
The case study method aims through real life examples to generate open
discussion among participants by providing a realistic illustration from the business
world. The method requires intellectual rigour and discipline. It reverses the classic
learning mechanisms taught at schools and universities. Whereas the latter approach
relies on theory to derive practical applications case studies require students to
analyse and interpret the available data in order to decide which actions to implement. 
At a later point the results may be generalized so as to apply to other situations; then
links with theory or new theories may emerge.
This learning method should be used by teachers and lecturers as it enables
students to capture better and to analyse faster and more effectively the problems
involved in managing a business.

Foreword  

This method has two major advantages. First active research and analysis by
students enables them to acquire knowledge more easily and in greater detail than
teaching methods based purely on theory; in the latter case students remain
completely passive in the learning environment. Secondly the analytical skills
acquired and developed in the context of a real life business situation are far more
important for making decisions than purely theoretical knowledge.
The case study method enables specifically to work on these two axes. Marketing
is a complex yet fluid field: multiple factors must be taken into accounting any
decision. Unfortunately it may be difficult to quantify many of these factors and
this makes the case method particularly suitable for education in marketing. The
case study method more than any other requires judgement and intellectual rigour 
analytical and decision-making skills: all these are essential in the field of
business.
This book presents ten company case studies taken from various fields of business: 
the motor industry the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry (Netbooks 
toys) specific sectors (sports real estate) and the B to B industry. The studies
illustrate the implications of analysing an environment which will enable the
identification of its most important elements and thus the choice of a corporate
strategy and finally of its implementation. The book is aimed atundergraduate and
postgraduate students of business marketing and strategy. The cases are designed to
be accessible to beginners and others involving concepts usually covered during the
second or third year of a marketing or business degree. Those studying for business
or professional degrees or short courses such as BTS and DUT will find this book
useful when learning about the specific application of the case study method which
is a frequent feature of examination questions.
Each Chapter below follows the same structure. The case study is presented 
describing the environment of the particular company and providing all the data
needed to identify the issue faced by the company. Additional information is
provided in several appendices giving a wider view of the company’s context and
environment. A set of exercises guides the reader helping him or her to construct a
solution based on his or her analysis. The second part of each Chapter suggests
answers: the exercises are reviewed one by one and the most important elements for
inclusion in the answers are cited bearing in mind as stated above that several
solutions are often possible. However all the case studies start with analyses of the
company’s environment and the industry within which it operates on one hand and
the company’s skills and competences on the other (external and internal
analyses).
To conclude we suggest a specific method for using this book and its contents. 
First the reader should absorb the contents of the case study by reading carefully
the first part of each Chapter: this will enable the identification of the salient facts
and issues of the environment in question. The data and information provided should

next be classified compared and synthesized (using tables graphs etc.) The student
will then be able to complete the exercises suggested at the end of each case study: 
at this stage it is important to highlight those elements which help to resolve the
issue at hand. Finally a well structured case study report should be drafted: starting
with a brief description of the company identifying the main issues and potential
associated issues and presenting the results of the analysis. The most detailed
section should be that which presents recommendations to the company accompanied
by comments and reasons. These suggestions should be critically discussed 
justifying the final choice.

A Gentle Reminder: Best practice in writing up a case study report

Writing a case study report involves following a few rules. These are as follows:
•A case study report is not an essay: it is a call for action to be read by the company’s
managers and executives. Thus it is of the utmost importance to state immediately in the
introduction the report’s conclusion (the action to be considered). This will avoid lengthy
argument and digression. The report should then set out the reasons for this recommendation 
rather than being written in an “investigative” mode which only identifies the solution at
its conclusion.
•A written report is a means of communication: to facilitate this it should include a table
of contents page numbering and all the other basic requirements of a properly formatted
document.
•A case study report should follow the structure: “This is the main problem of the case
study [...] The secondary problems are these [...] To solve these problems this is what we
recommend [...] and here are the reasons why [...]”
Finally some pitfalls to avoid:
•A case study report should not simply paraphrase the text provided. Avoid at all costs
rewriting the case word-for-word or copying figures tables or graphs already included in
the case study.
•Recommendations should be clear and unambiguous and supported by as much
corroborative data as possible.
•The presentation style of a document is as important as its content: both elements affect
the reader’s perception of the analysis proposed. The report should be written in a simple 
direct and concise style.
•Finally subjective phrases such as “it seems” “I (we) believe” “in my (our) opinion” and
“it is obvious that” should be avoided.

Case

 Case synopsis
Research problem
How to succeed in the PVC window market?

Case summary
This case study is based on real events which occurred in 2010. It describes the
launch by MPO Fenêtres of new windows characterised by improved thermal per-
formance achieved by the use of triple glazing.
This company is based in the French region of Orne. It has 200 employees and
realized a turnover of over €35 million in 2010. It has positioned itself as an innova-
tive company always seeking to apply the latest technical developments.
In the current economic crisis customers are more careful with their money and
think more carefully about potential purchases. In recent years it has been shown
that consumers’ purchasing behaviour has evolved and that criteria such as sustain-
able development and environmental protection are now among the factors that
may influence purchasing decisions. In this sense an “ecological consciousness” 
has emerged. Not only the Grenelle de l’Environnement (a French forum for the
discussion of issues relating to sustainable development) and government standards 
but also tax credits associated with the purchase of certain goods have affected the
housing industry and therefore also window manufacturers. Rebuilding and reno-
vation are also subject to these factors.
